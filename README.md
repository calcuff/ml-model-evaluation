# Machine Learning Model Evaluation

This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of several supervised machine learning algorithms on challenging datasets. The goal is to compare the generalization performance of different models and analyze their strengths and weaknesses under varying data conditions.

## Overview

We benchmark the following algorithms:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Neural Network**

Each model is evaluated across one or more datasets with characteristics such as class imbalance, high dimensionality, and noisy features.

## Objectives

- Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- Explore the effect of dataset complexity on model generalization.
- Highlight trade-offs in bias-variance and model interpretability.
- Provide reproducible code and structured analysis for future comparison studies.

##  Datasets

The datasets used include:
- [Dataset 1] – e.g., UCI Breast Cancer
- [Dataset 2] – e.g., Noisy Synthetic Data
- [Dataset 3] – e.g., Imbalanced Class Data
